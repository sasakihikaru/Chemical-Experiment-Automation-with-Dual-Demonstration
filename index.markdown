<div class="notice--primary">
While robotic automation has demonstrated remarkable performance, such as executing hundreds of experiments continuously over several days, designing synchronized motions between the robot and experimental jigs remains challenging, especially for flexible experimental automation.
This challenge stems from the fact that even minor changes in experimental conditions often require extensive reprogramming of both robot motions and jig control commands.
Previous systems lack the flexibility to accommodate frequent updates, limiting their practical utility in actual laboratories.
To update robotic automation systems flexibly by chemists, we propose a concept that enables the automation of experiments by utilizing dual demonstrations of robot motions and jig operations by chemists.
To verify this concept, we developed a chemical-experiment-automation system consisting of jigs to assist the robot in experiments, a motion-demonstration interface, a jig-control interface, and a mobile manipulator.
We validate the concept through polymer-synthesis experiments, focusing on critical liquid-handling tasks such as pipetting and dilution.
The experimental results indicate high reproducibility of the demonstrated motions and robust task-success rates.
This comprehensive concept not only simplifies the robot programming process for chemists but also provides a flexible and efficient solution to accommodate a wide range of experimental conditions, providing a practical framework for intuitive and adaptable robotic laboratory automation.

## Overview
This paper proposes a dual demonstration-based robotic system for automating chemical experiments. Instead of manually programming robot motions and jig operations, chemists demonstrate the actions using an intuitive interface and jig controller. The robot then reproduces the task precisely, streamlining automation for complex lab workflows.
Concept of dual demonstration: (a) chemist demonstrates using the interface and jigs, (b) robot executes the task.

## System Architecture

The developed system integrates four main components:
- A motion-demonstration interface that mimics the robot's gripper
- Specialized experimental jigs for tasks such as pipetting and bottle handling
- A mobile manipulator (UR5e on MiR200)
- A motion-capture system for recording demonstrations
The demonstration phase and execution phase are connected through a time-synchronized data logging and control pipeline.
System overview is shown in Fig. 4.

## Experiments 

### Settings
To validate the system, a simulated polymer synthesis workflow was designed. It consisted of three workspaces:
- Polymer sampling
- Bottle manipulation for dilution
- Pipetting operation

To evaluate the proposed dual demonstration system, we conducted a full-cycle experiment simulating a polymer synthesis workflow.
In each task, a chemsit demonstrated a motion once and then the motions are autonomously executed by the mobile manipulator.

### Results
The robot performed all actions based on a single human demonstration, including bottle manipulation, polymer sampling, and dilution.
The results confirm the system's precision, synchronization, and reliability across complex, multi-step tasks.

#### Task 1: Polymer Sampling
At Workspace 1, the robot:
- Retrieves a bottle from the case
- Opens the cap
- Samples polymer (colored water)
- Closes the cap and returns the bottle
